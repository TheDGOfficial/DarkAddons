# DarkAddons

DarkAddons is a mod focused around Hypixel Skyblock, providing Quality of Life features/enchancements, along with other general performance enchancing features.

# Note

This mod is mainly created for personal use by me and is currently not released in any mainstream platform like Modrinth or CurseForge and does not yet have any official Discord server for support and/or communication. If you want to go ahead to using it you can still do so by the GitHub Releases section, but keep in mind that support might be limited and features that myself use will be prioritized in development.

# Dependencies

DarkAddons currently requires the Skytils mod as a dependency to function, your game will likely crash without it. This due to keeping the JAR size small, deduplicating classes and not having to reinvent the wheel. The mod uses Utils classes, APIs and libraries bundled by Skytils for the reasons mentioned earlier.
